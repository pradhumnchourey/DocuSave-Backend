Features to consider:

1. Document Categories or Tags: Allow users to categorize or tag their uploaded documents. This feature would enable users to organize their documents better and make it easier for them to find specific documents later on.

2. Document Preview: Provide users with a preview of their documents directly on the home screen. This feature can enhance user experience by allowing them to quickly glance at the contents of a document without having to download or open it separately.

3. Document Sharing: Implement the ability for users to share their documents with other users. This could involve generating shareable links or inviting specific users to view or collaborate on a document. Adding social features like document sharing can make your application more interactive and engaging.

4. Document Versioning: Introduce version control for documents, allowing users to upload new versions of existing documents while retaining access to previous versions. This feature can be valuable for users who frequently update their documents and want to keep track of changes over time.

5. Document Analytics: Provide insights into document usage and activity, such as the number of views, downloads, or interactions with each document. This feature can help users understand how their documents are being utilized and identify trends or patterns in document access.

6. Document Reminders: Allow users to set reminders for specific documents. This feature can help users stay organized and on top of important deadlines or tasks associated with their documents.

7. OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Implement OCR functionality to extract text from uploaded documents, making the text searchable and editable. This can improve document discoverability and enable users to perform text-based operations on their documents.

8. Document Collaboration: Enable real-time collaboration on documents, allowing multiple users to edit or comment on the same document simultaneously. Collaborative editing features can enhance teamwork and productivity for users working on shared documents.

9. Document Access Control: Introduce granular access control settings for documents, allowing users to specify who can view, edit, or delete their documents. This feature can enhance privacy and security for sensitive documents shared within the application.

10. Document Templates: Provide users with pre-defined document templates for common use cases (e.g., resumes, invoices, reports). Users can then customize these templates to suit their needs, saving time and effort in document creation.
