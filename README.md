Problems:
1. It is asking for username and password for sign up form as well, so we need to implement, something called Ignoring.method(), which disables authenticates for certain methods.
2. Need to implement/connect Login method with the FrontEnd, which redirects to Home page if the user is validated.

1. Removed security for Sign Up Form.
2. Set up default form login to "/Login".
3. Can also work on two-factor authentication.
